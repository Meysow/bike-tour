- Team is growing and onboarding is painful
- You want better developer experience
- You need rich translation features

❌ **Don't migrate if:**

- SEO URLs are driving significant traffic
- You've just started and haven't tested benefits
- No developer bandwidth for migration

---

### When to Consider Paraglide.js

✅ **Consider if:**

- Performance is critical
- You want compile-time checks
- Bundle size matters
- You're okay with newer technology

❌ **Don't use if:**

- You need maximum stability
- You want extensive documentation
- You need large community support

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### Current Approach at Different Scales

| Scale                      | Feasibility        | Maintenance Load      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| **5 pages, 5 languages**   | ✅ Good            | Low (2h/month)        |
| **10 pages, 5 languages**  | ⚠️ Okay            | Medium (4h/month)     |
| **20 pages, 5 languages**  | ⚠️ Challenging     | High (8h/month)       |
| **50 pages, 5 languages**  | ❌ Very difficult  | Very High (20h/month) |
| **10 pages, 10 languages** | ❌ Not recommended | Extreme (30h/month)   |

**Current project**: ~7 pages, 5 languages = **Okay zone** ⚠️

## 🔀 Migration Complexity

### From Current → Other Approaches

| Target                 | Difficulty | Time      | Breaking Changes      | SEO Impact                |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Pure next-intl**     | ⚠️ Medium  | 2 weeks   | URL structure changes | ❌ High (need redirects)  |
| **Paraglide.js**       | ⚠️ Medium  | 2-3 weeks | Translation syntax    | ⚠️ Medium (can keep URLs) |
| **Custom improvement** | ✅ Low     | 1 week    | None                  | ✅ None                   |

**Recommendation**: Start with custom improvements before considering full migration

## 🎨 Developer Experience Comparison

### Writing a New Page

#### Current Approach

```typescript
// 1. Create page file
// app/[locale]/contact/page.tsx
export default function ContactPage() {
  const { createLink } = useLocalizedRoutes();
  return <Link href={createLink("home")}>Home</Link>;
}

// 2. Add to routes config
// config/routes.ts
contact: {
  en: "/contact-us",
  fr: "/nous-contacter",
  de: "/kontakt",
  nl: "/contact",
  es: "/contacto",
  filePath: "/contact",
}

// 3. Add navigation labels (if needed)
// config/navigation.ts
contact: {
  en: "Contact",
  fr: "Contact",
  de: "Kontakt",
  nl: "Contact",
  es: "Contacto",
}
```

**Steps**: 3 files to edit
**Lines of code**: ~30 lines
**Error prone**: Yes (typos, missing languages)

---

#### next-intl Approach

```typescript
// 1. Create page file
// app/[locale]/contact/page.tsx
import { useTranslations } from 'next-intl';

export default function ContactPage() {
  const t = useTranslations('contact');
  return <Link href="/home">{t('backToHome')}</Link>;
}

// 2. Add translations
// messages/en.json
{
  "contact": {
    "title": "Contact Us",
    "backToHome": "Back to Home"
  }
}
// Repeat for fr.json, de.json, etc.
```

**Steps**: 2 files to edit
**Lines of code**: ~15 lines
**Error prone**: Less (validation available)
