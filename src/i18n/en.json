A deductible of 10% of the repair bill, with a minimum of ‚Ç¨10, will be payable in the event of breakage, and a deductible of 10% of the value of the cycle in the event of irreparable breakage or theft. Please note that the guarantee does not in any way exempt the customer from taking the necessary steps, such as filing a complaint, making a sworn statement or providing any evidence that may be requested by the insurer as part of the management and resolution of the claim. In case of theft the renter must declare any accident to Rentabike Paris as well as the police authorities before the end of the rental period, and in all cases within 24 hours - under penalty of losing the benefit of the insurance."
